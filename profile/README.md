# Structural Explainability

This work develops foundational structural constraints on ontological substrates
intended to support accountability and interoperability under persistent interpretive disagreement.
It establishes what must be true of any such substrate prior to concrete ontology design or implementation.

## Overview

Structural Explainability is a foundational research program
concerned with the design of **neutral representational substrates**
that preserve stable reference and accountability
under persistent disagreement.

The work develops structural constraints on ontology design
independently of domain, policy, or interpretive framework,
with a focus on identity, persistence, and extension stability.

## Scope

Structural Explainability addresses questions such as:

- What structural commitments are unavoidable if disagreement is persistent?
- How can accountability be represented without embedding causal or normative assumptions?
- What identity and persistence regimes are required for stable reference?

The results are theoretical and constraint-based.
They are not proposals for domain ontologies or protocols.

## Core Results

- Ontological neutrality requires pre-causal and pre-normative substrates
- Exactly six identity-and-persistence regimes are necessary and sufficient
  for neutral accountability under persistent disagreement

## Relationship to Civic Interconnect

Structural Explainability provides the theoretical foundation
for the Civic Interconnect ecosystem, including
Accountable Entities (AE), the Civic Exchange Protocol (CEP),
and Contextual Evidence and Explanations (CEE).
